## Authorization Flow

The OAuth 2.0 authorization flow consists of the following steps:

1. Redirect the user to our authorization page
2. User grants permissions
3. User is redirected back to your application with an authorization code
4. Your application exchanges the code for access and refresh tokens
5. Use the access token to make API requests
6. Refresh the token when it expires
